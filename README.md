PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a dual-stage classifier. In the first stage, it classifies the disease and its cause based on symptoms. In the second stage, it classifies medicine based on the disease. This project provides a specific disease based on the symptoms instead of a whole set of diseases, which could overwhelm users. It classifies not only the disease and medicine but also the cause using multi-label classification along with
the disease from symptoms, which will help to identify the cause of the disease as well.
